Visage
======

Visage is a web interface for viewing [collectd](http://collectd.org) statistics.

It also provides a [JSON](http://json.org) interface onto `collectd`'s RRD data,
giving you an easy way to mash up the data.

Features
--------

 * renders graphs in the browser, and retrieves data asynchronously
 * interactive graph keys, to highlight lines and toggle line visibility
 * drop-down or mouse selection of timeframes (also rendered asynchronously)
 * JSON interface onto `collectd` RRDs

Here, have a graph:

Installing
----------

N.B: Visage must be deployed on a machine where `collectd` stores its stats in RRD.

On Ubuntu, to install dependencies run:

    $ sudo apt-get install -y build-essential librrd-ruby ruby ruby-dev rubygems collectd

On CentOS, to install dependencies run:

    $ sudo yum install -y ruby-rrdtool ruby rubygems collectd

Then install the app with:

    $ gem install visage-app

Running
-------

You can try out Visage quickly with:

    $ visage-app start

Then paste the URL from the output into your browser.

If you get a `command not found` when running the above command (RubyGems likely
isn't on your PATH), try this instead:

    $ $(dirname $(dirname $(gem which visage-app)))/bin/visage-app start

Deploying
---------

Visage can be deployed on Apache with Passenger:

    $ sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-passenger

Visage can attempt to generate an Apache vhost config for use with Passenger:

    $ visage-app genapache
    <VirtualHost *>
      ServerName ubuntu.localdomain
      ServerAdmin root@ubuntu.localdomain

      DocumentRoot /home/user/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/visage-app-0.1.0/lib/visage-app/public

      <Directory "/home/user/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/visage-app-0.1.0/lib/visage-app/public">
         Options FollowSymLinks Indexes
         AllowOverride None
         Order allow,deny
         Allow from all
       </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

Copypasta this into your system's Apache config structure and tune to taste.

To do this on Debian/Ubuntu:

    $ sudo -s
    $ visage-app genapache > /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/visage
    $ a2dissite default
    $ service apache2 reload

Then head to your Apache instance and Visage will be up and running.

Configuring
-----------

Visage looks for two environment variables when starting up:

  * `CONFIG_PATH`, an entry on the configuration file search path
  * `RRDDIR`, the location of collectd's RRDs

Visage has a configuration search path which can be used for overriding
individual files. By default it has one entry: `$VISAGE_ROOT/lib/visage/config/`.
You can set the `CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to add another directory to
the config load path. This directory will be searched when loading up
configuration files.

    CONFIG_PATH=/var/lib/visage-app start

This is especially useful when you want to deploy + run Visage from an installed
gem with Passenger. e.g.

    <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName monitoring.example.org
      ServerAdmin me@example.org

      SetEnv CONFIG_PATH /var/lib/visage
      SetEnv RRDDIR /opt/collectd/var/lib/collectd

      DocumentRoot /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/visage-app-0.3.0/lib/visage/public
      <Directory />
        Options FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
      </Directory>

      LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b" common
      CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log common
    </VirtualHost>

Also to keep in mind when deploying with Passenger, the `CONFIG_PATH` directory
and its files need to have the correct ownership:

    chown nobody:nogroup -R /var/lib/visage

Developing + testing
--------------------

Check out the code with:

    $ git clone git://github.com/auxesis/visage.git

Install the development dependencies with

    $ gem install shotgun rack-test rspec cucumber webrat

And run the app with:

    $ shotgun visage.rb

Create and install a new gem from the current source tree:

    $ rake install

Run all cucumber features:

    $ rake cucumber

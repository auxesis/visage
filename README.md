Visage
======

Visage is a web interface for viewing [collectd](http://collectd.org) statistics.

It also provides a [JSON](http://json.org) interface onto `collectd`'s RRD data,
giving you an easy way to mash up the data.

Features
--------

 * Renders graphs in the browser with SVG, and retrieves data asynchronously
 * Easy interface for building, ordering, and sharing collections of graphs
 * Interactive graph elements - toggle line visibility, inspect exact point-in-time data
 * Drop-down or mouse selection of timeframes
 * JSON interface onto collectd RRDs
 * Support for FLUSH using either collectd's rrdtool plugin, or rrdcached

Here, have a graph:

Installing
----------

N.B: Visage must be deployed on a machine where `collectd` stores its stats in RRD.

### Ubuntu ###

On Ubuntu, to install dependencies run:

``` bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential librrd-ruby ruby ruby-dev rubygems collectd
```

Then install the app with:

``` bash
gem install visage-app
```

### CentOS/RHEL ###

#### CentOS/RHEL 5 ####
Visage uses [yajl-ruby](https://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby) to work with
JSON, which requires Ruby >= 1.8.6. CentOS/RHEL 5 ship with Ruby 1.8.5, so you
will need to use [Ruby Enterprise Edition](http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/).

[Endpoint](http://endpoint.com) provide packages for REE and a [Yum repository](https://packages.endpoint.com/)
to ease installation.

Follow the above instructions for installing REE, and then run:

``` bash
sudo yum install -y librrd-dev ruby rubygems collectd
gem install librrd
```

Then install the app with:

``` bash
gem install visage-app
```

#### CentOS/RHEL 6+ ####

On CentOS 6, to install dependencies run:

``` bash
sudo yum install -y ruby-RRDtool ruby ruby-devel rubygems collectd
```

Then install the app with:

``` bash
gem install visage-app
```

### Mac OS X ###

Visage is not supported on Mac OS X, as RRDtool is a pain in the arse on that
platform. It's highly recommended you use [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) to
fire up an Ubuntu box to run Visage.


Running
-------

You can try out Visage quickly with:

``` bash
visage-app start
```

Then paste the URL from the output into your browser.

If you get a `command not found` when running the above command (RubyGems likely
isn't on your PATH), try this instead:

``` bash
$(dirname $(dirname $(gem which visage-app)))/bin/visage-app start
```

Deploying
---------

Visage can be deployed easily on Apache with Passenger:

``` bash
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-passenger
```

Visage can attempt to generate an Apache vhost config for use with Passenger:

``` bash
$ visage-app genapache
<VirtualHost *>
  ServerName ubuntu.localdomain
  ServerAdmin root@ubuntu.localdomain

  DocumentRoot /home/user/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/visage-app-0.1.0/lib/visage-app/public

  <Directory "/home/user/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/visage-app-0.1.0/lib/visage-app/public">
     Options FollowSymLinks Indexes
     AllowOverride None
     Order allow,deny
     Allow from all
   </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

Copypasta this into your system's Apache config structure and tune to taste.

To do this on Debian/Ubuntu:

``` bash
sudo -s
visage-app genapache > /etc/apache2/sites-available/visage
a2ensite visage
a2dissite default
service apache2 reload
```

Then visit your Apache instance in a browser, and Visage will be up and running.

Configuring
-----------

Visage looks for some environment variables when starting up:

  * `CONFIG_PATH`, an entry on the configuration file search path.
  * `RRDDIR`, the location of collectd's RRDs.
  * `COLLECTDSOCK`, the location of collectd's Unix socket.
  * `RRDCACHEDSOCK`, the location of rrdcached's Unix socket.
  * `VISAGE_DATA_BACKEND`, which storage backend to retrieve data from.

Visage has a configuration search path which can be used for overriding
individual files. By default it has one entry: `$VISAGE_ROOT/lib/visage/config/`.
You can set the `CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to add another directory to
the config load path. This directory will be searched when loading up
configuration files:

``` bash
CONFIG_PATH=/var/lib/visage visage-app start
```

This is especially useful when you want to deploy + run Visage from an installed
gem with Passenger. e.g.

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName monitoring.example.org
  ServerAdmin me@example.org

  SetEnv CONFIG_PATH /var/lib/visage
  SetEnv RRDDIR /opt/collectd/var/lib/collectd

  DocumentRoot /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/visage-app-0.3.0/lib/visage/public
  <Directory />
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
  </Directory>

  LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b" common
  CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log common
</VirtualHost>
```

Also to keep in mind when deploying with Passenger, the `CONFIG_PATH` directory
and its files need to have the correct ownership:

``` bash
chown nobody:nogroup -R /var/lib/visage
```

Developing + testing
--------------------

Check out the code:

``` bash
git clone git://github.com/auxesis/visage.git
```

Install the development dependencies:

``` bash
bundle
```

Run all the cukes:

``` bash
rake
```

Visage tests should pass every time. [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/auxesis/visage) says the current Visage is ![build status](https://travis-ci.org/auxesis/visage.png?branch=master).

Run the app with:

``` bash
VISAGE_DATA_BACKEND=Mock bundle exec shotgun lib/visage-app/config.ru -p 9292 -o 0.0.0.0 --server thin
```

Visage ships a Mock data backend, so you can test without needing a real instance of collectd writing data with the RRDtool plugin. Per the above example, you can enable it by specifying the `VISAGE_DATA_BACKEND=Mock` environment variable on the command line.

To create and install a new gem from the current source tree:

``` bash
rake build
```

Releasing
---------

1. Bump the version in `lib/visage-app/version.rb`
2. Add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md`
3. `git commit` everything.
4. Build the gem with `rake build`
5. Push the gem to RubyGems.org with `rake push`
